# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security updates are applied only to the most recent release.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you have discovered a security vulnerability in this project, please report
it privately. **Do not disclose it as a public issue.** This gives me time to
work with you to fix the issue before public exposure, reducing the chance that
the exploit will be used before a patch is released.

Please disclose it at [security advisory](https://github.com/nilsschmidt1337/ldparteditor/security/advisories/new).

This project is maintained by one volunteer on a reasonable-effort basis.
As such, please give me at least 90 days to work on a fix before public exposure.
